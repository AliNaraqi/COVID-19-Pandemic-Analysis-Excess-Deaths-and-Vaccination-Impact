# COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis: Excess Deaths and Vaccination Impact

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 cases, excess deaths, and vaccination campaigns across 34 countries from 2020-2023. By merging emergency department (ED) excess mortality data with comprehensive COVID-19 metrics, we explore how vaccination campaigns and pandemic waves affected mortality rates globally.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Examine the correlation** between COVID-19 metrics and excess deaths
- Evaluate vaccination impact on reducing excess mortality
- Identify pandemic waves** and temporal patterns in excess deaths
- Compare pre-vaccine vs post-vaccine periods** to assess vaccine effectiveness
- Visualize trends** across different countries and time periods

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

The initial dataset is provided in `archive.zip` which contains:
- `covid.csv` - COVID-19 data with 373,495 records
- `ED.csv` - Excess deaths data with 135,628 records
